Requirements:
Need Gui to interact with exiting functions of gui.py
tkinter gui can be a separate file ,interface with gui.py

1. Market Price Box : Fetch the price from def check_positions(data): every one 30seconds once and update
2. if "BuyLimit" or "SellLimit" of GUI is clicked ,immedeiate update the Market Price Box by taking value from check_positions(data)
3.Between the White Box ,"Buy Limit" provide tick Box for value 1 5 10 20 25 40 (one value can be selected at a time)
4.Between the White Box ,"Sell Limit" provide button for value 1 5 10 20 25 40 (one value can be selected at a time)

5. If Buy Limit is clicked then take the "Market Price" SUM(-) tick Box value and update the While Box 
       and pass this new value to function  def buylimit_order(price):

6  If Sell Limit is clicked then take the "Market Price" Minus (-) tick Box value and update the While Box 
       and pass this new value to function  selllimit_order(sellprice):


7 provide click button for Cancell order,Close order, Limit order ,StopOrder ,when clicking this certain function should be called in guy.py example Cancell_order() ,limit_order(), stopOrder() etc

8.provide four Box under grouped order(label) where user can enter 4 differrent numerical values limit two box to 0 and greater ,limit two other Box  for minus and plus value (user can enter minus value)
    Add a button ClickSend when clicked assign this value to 4 variables and pass it to  def grouporder(price1,2x,3x,4x):

9.Add a button "FetchData" when clicked fetch data from refresh_tokenn() and display the value fetched in GUI.


Bottom of the GUI add this Lists[NY,DY,AY,PY] and give drop down menu and the value chosen dynamically update in a variable.





10. Add Exit button so when clicked the program should stop (provide a function call for this so that if i want to add any more activity i can do before exit)

11.On Top of the GUI add this tick Box  Exchang A ,Exchange B only one can be selected (tick,Button anything can be done)

so when particular exhange is selected in a function decide in if else condtion  Exchang A ,Exchange B is selected here i will call other function depends on the exchange chosen.

Note Program should run continuously and take user interactive input and do the operation until pgrm is closed.
mainly BuyLimit ,SellLimit orders whenever we click it should be done ,#1 requirement should be updated every 30Seconds ,all other requirements are based on user interaction in the GUI.
